<h1>InLine - never wait in line again</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The idea of this web app is to digitize all types of physical queues, including the lines at airports, hospitals and banks. Why waste your precious time with waiting in a physical line, when you can let a digital avatar do the waiting for you?

InLine does just that - it allows organizations to create virtual lines that their clients can let their avatars participate in, thus enabling them to spend their waiting time as they wish. They can also see the estimated time left to their turn, get directions to the line's location and chat with the admins of the line.
